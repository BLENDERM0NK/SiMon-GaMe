- How to play
  - Press any key to start the game.
  - Watch the sequence of colors as they are highlighted and associated sounds play.
  - Click the buttons in the same sequence as shown.
  - With each correct repetition, the sequence length increases by one.
  - The game ends when you click a wrong color or fail to remember the sequence.
  - The game will display "Game Over" and prompt you to press a key to restart.

- Features
  - Responsive Design: The game layout is designed to adapt to different screen sizes.
  - Color and Sound Sequences: Each color button has a unique sound, and the game randomly generates a sequence of colors for the player to follow.
  - Progressive Difficulty: As the player successfully repeats the sequence, the level increases, and the sequence becomes longer.
  - Game Over Feedback: The game provides visual and audio feedback when the player makes a mistake, and allows restarting after game over.
 
- Technologies Used
  - HTML: Structure of the game interface.
  - CSS: Styling for the game buttons and layout.
  - JavaScript & jQuery: Logic for handling game functionality, animations, and user interactions.
